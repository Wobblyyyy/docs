!["docs;" logo](logo.png)
Here's a lovely little web portal, leading to the documentation for all of my various projects.
This documentation is written in markdown files and converted to look pretty beautiful by using
GitHub Pages in combination with Jekyll. The theme, in case you're wondering, is JustTheDocs
(dark mode), a Jekyll documentation theme available [here](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs).

## Available Docs
Most of my repositories on GitHub are documented and linked here. Even if documentation is scarse, I'm
doing my best to document just about every line of code I write. In the name of consistency, the format
for each documentation link is as follows - without the block quote formatting, of course.
> **Example**
> - Documentation Status: *The status of the project's documentation.*
> - Description: *A description of the project.*
> - GitHub Repository: [*A link to the repository.*](https://google.com)
> - JavaDoc link: [*A link to the JavaDoc for the project*](https://google.com) *Please note that not
> all of the repositories I've documented are written in Java or have JavaDocs, so this link might
> not be there. Oh well.*
