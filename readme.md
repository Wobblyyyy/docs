!["docs;" logo](logo.png)
Here's a lovely little web portal, leading to the documentation for all of my various projects.
This documentation is written in markdown files and converted to look pretty beautiful by using
GitHub Pages in combination with Jekyll. The theme, in case you're wondering, is JustTheDocs
(dark mode), a Jekyll documentation theme available [here](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs).

See the sidebar on the left side of the screen to see available documentation.
